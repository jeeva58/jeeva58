Hello There!! ✨
I am Jeeva Jaleesh, an undergraduate student in Information Science & Engineering.
I'm interested in Full stack development, Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning and Data Science.
I am currently learning Front End development and working on a basic project in AI-ML.
I like Reading books, creating art, writing and watching anime.
I hope to gain a lot of knowledge and be able to apply it to create some good, useful projects.
